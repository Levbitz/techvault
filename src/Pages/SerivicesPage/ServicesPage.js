              <p>
                Have you considered room acoustics? That's my first question
                when people ask me for home theatre advice. Your theatre's
                acoustic environment is as important to your system's sound
                quality as any single component.

              <h3> Home AUTOMATION</h3>
              <p>
                Home automation gives you remote and automatic control of a wide
                array of devices in your home. Home automation can also alert
                you to events that you might want to know about right-away while
                you are gone like water leaks and unexpected access to your
                home, or any part of it. At any time, you can grab your iPhone,
                Android device or other remote control and change the settings
                in your house as desired. For automation, you dictate how a
                device should react, when it should react, and why it should
                react. You set the schedule and the rest is automated and based
                off of your personal preferences thus providing convenience,
                control, money savings, and an overall smarter home
              </p>
              <p>
                Control and automate just about every device and appliance
                within your home whether you are at home or far away. We’ve all
                gotten used to controlling our TV from the couch; just wait
                until you are able to dim the lights as well. Imagine adjusting
                the temperature from your bed or controlling the volume of your
                whole-house audio system from any room. Or imagine the
                wall/ceiling heater in your bathroom coming on automatically on
                chilly mornings 5 minutes before your alarm clock goes off so
                that it is warm when you enter. Many Smart home products also
                save energy — we’ll all agree that’s a nice convenience
              </p>
              <p>
                We’re all used to opening the garage door from the car, but
                you’ll be surprised how much safer you’ll feel coming home to a
                lit home and even turning on more lights from your key fob
                remote upon your arrival. With a couple of basic products, you
                can have your whole house light up like Fort Knox when there is
                motion detected at any corner of your house. Imagine your house
                sending you an email if there is motion where there shouldn’t be
                any. Or you can have your security system call you if there is
                an alarm, which might include your typical security alarm or
                even a low or high temperature or water in the laundry room or
                basement.

              <p>
                Home automation gets you involved. Set your personal preferences
                and actions, then sit back and enjoy using the latest in-home
                automation technology. Though such technology is quite complex,
                it remains completely flexible and user-friendly making for a
                fun experience. High-tech products for the home are fun to use
                and share with others. Whether viewing visitors at your front
                door on your TV or tuning your stereo by using voice
                recognition, you’ll find home automation surprisingly enjoyable.
                And when it comes to impressing the friends, you’ll be happy to
                show off your newfound applications.
